      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this website is to have a place to keep my projects, my resume, and other things I have worked on in a single website. This will act as an online portfolio 
        similar to online art stations or graphic designer hubs were they can show all of their work.
      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Ideally, the audience will be future employers that I am seeking work with or other employers looking at my work. Everyone who is interested in what I do is my audience. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        For context, I have decided that for my website I would like to turn it into a portfolio. But I haven’t exactly gone into detail about what this portfolio is going to contain. 
        But what does a portfolio usually have? Photos, game demos, and 3D art. Like these examples I want my portfolio website to do exactly that, to show the things that I have worked on 
        and the work-in-progress projects that I am currently working on. Granted, at this point in time I don’t have much in the way of completed or in-progress projects. 
        If anything, I have the projects that I have completed in previous classes. But that can be a good thing. It means that I can have a place to put all of this. 
        
        I’m thinking in terms of topics that I want to cover on my pages I think the Home Page is where all my projects should show up. Front and center. I think I’ll show 
        off 3 – 4 projects that I’ve used with photos and maybe a demo video. I’ll also include links to other pages to be used but I’ll go over those later. Home Page is 
        where employers and interested people can see all the things that I have worked on.

      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        The About Me Page is where I’m going to break down who I am as a person. Think of it as a long-form resume were I go in depth about who I am, where I am from, and what I hope to 
        accomplish in the future. I want this page to really shine so that employers can see who I am as a person to make me appear more valuable as a future employee who has interests and 
        hobbies outside the sphere of computer programming. In the future, I could add onto this page for places I worked at or big projects I was apart of. Everything in one place. 
        There won’t be much for activity on this particular page because it will more or less act as a resume page. Maybe one or two hyperlinks could be included to send visitors 
        to a LinkedIn page or even a GitHub page to showcase even more things. I would that this page really lets me stand out from the others. I believe it is important as we go further 
        and further into a technological era I know of the importance of making yourself known with a digital footprint.

      </ul>
      <h3>Contact Me | FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        You might ask, “What’s the difference between the FAQ page and the About Me page? Its quite simple, here is where I will have my contact information if someone wishes to get 
        in contact with me regarding work as well as common questions that can be answered like what kind of work do I do, what languages I work with, where to contact me for business 
        opportunities etc. I believe this will be a good place to also reiterate on the important information. The Home Page or the About Me page may become a bit too cluttered with 
        information for someone to quickly pick up where the important bits of information should be. So I believe having a final page to answer those questions and house the important 
        information is important to what I hope can be accomplished. 

        Having said all that. In terms of looks, I believe my website will look more as an informatic rather than an advertisement. The Home Page will be dominated by photos of my 
        projects while the other pages may have a couple stock photos to sell the theme.
